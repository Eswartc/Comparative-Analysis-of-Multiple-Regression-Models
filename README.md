Apologies for the oversight. Let's add the descriptions of the four regression models used in the README file.

# Profit Prediction with Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for performing regression analysis to predict profit based on R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas openpyxl matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend
```

## Description

The script provides a versatile approach to predict profit using various regression algorithms:

### 1. Linear Regression
Linear regression is a basic regression technique that establishes a linear relationship between the dependent variable (profit) and independent variables (R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend). It aims to minimize the distance between actual and predicted values using a straight line.

### 2. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression extends linear regression by introducing higher-order polynomial terms to fit more complex relationships between variables. It can capture non-linear trends in the data and is useful when the relationship is not strictly linear.

### 3. Lasso Regression
Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, adds a penalty term to the linear regression objective function, encouraging some of the coefficients to be exactly zero. It performs feature selection and helps to eliminate less important features, preventing overfitting.

### 4. Ridge Regression
Ridge regression, or L2 regularization, adds a penalty term to the linear regression objective function that discourages large coefficients. It can help mitigate the problem of multicollinearity and stabilize the model's performance.

## Usage

1. Run the script and provide the required input values for R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend when prompted.

2. The script will use the trained model to predict the profit for the provided input.

3. It will display a scatter plot of the predicted values against the actual values, allowing you to visualize the model's performance.(Just comment it out in the code)

4. The script calculates evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R-squared score, and Mean Percentage Error, to comprehensively assess the model's performance.

## File Naming Convention

For consistency, the regression models are named in the format `[ModelName]Regression.py`, such as `LinearRegression.py`, `PolynomialRegression.py`, `LassoRegression.py`, and `RidgeRegression.py`.

## Predicting Profit for New Data

You can use this script to predict profit for new data by providing R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend as input.
